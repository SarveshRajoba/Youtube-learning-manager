Perfect! Now I have a complete understanding of how InfoVault implements authentication and API integration. Let me summarize the key learnings and apply them to fix the YouTube Learning Manager app.
ðŸŽ¯ Key Learnings from InfoVault Implementation
1. Authentication Pattern (Much Better!)
JWT with HTTP-only cookies instead of localStorage
Clean separation between auth and API controllers
Proper error handling and redirects
No complex Devise configuration - uses has_secure_password
2. API Integration Pattern
Service class pattern for external APIs
Environment variable for API key
Proper error handling and logging
Structured response parsing
3. Controller Organization
Simple authentication with before_action :authenticate_user
Clear separation of concerns
Proper redirects and flash messages
